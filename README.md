ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JonathanRReed, a neuroscience student interested in tech-driven solutions.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m really interested in medical neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and ML-driven solutions.

ðŸŒ± Currently I'm learning advanced medical neuroscience at UT Dallas & exploring machine learning.

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m not currently looking to collaborate much due to on-going school; but would still love to see if I can make it fit in my schedule.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Connect via LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/JonathanRReed0 or email jonathanrayreed@gmail.com.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

âš¡ Fun fact: In my spare time, I enjoy red-teaming new AI models & keeping up with the latest neuroscience papers.
